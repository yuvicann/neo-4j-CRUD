# neo4j-CRUD
Implemented CRUD operations using neo4j graph DB
Objective:
The objective of this assignment is to develop a complete application that performs CRUD
(Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a Neo4j graph database using Python. You will
implement wrapper functions for each CRUD operation and integrate these functions with the
FastAPI framework to expose these operations as RESTful APIs.
Requirements:
1. Set Up Neo4j Database:
○ Install and configure Neo4j.
○ Create a database and node labels for the assignment.
2. Implement CRUD Wrapper Functions:
○ Create a Python module to connect to the Neo4j database.
○ Implement wrapper functions for Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations.
3. Develop RESTful APIs with FastAPI:
○ Install FastAPI and Uvicorn.
○ Create a FastAPI application that exposes the CRUD operations as RESTful
APIs.
○ Integrate the CRUD wrapper functions with the FastAPI endpoints.
4. Test the Application:
○ Test the CRUD operations through the FastAPI endpoints using a tool like
Postman or curl.
